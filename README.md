Python functions for analysis of the overt covert project

This first submission uploads the relevant code for computing
gridscores and simulating cells with inhomogenous poisson processes.

The code is provided 'as is', i.e. with barely any documentation. However,
a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how the code can be used is in the 
making. In the meantime don't hesitate to contact me with questions.

Please be aware that some of the code uses cython which needs to be 
compiled before it can be used.
